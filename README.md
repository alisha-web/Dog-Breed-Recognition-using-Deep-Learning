# Dog-Breed-Recognition-using-Deep-Learning
This project aims to develop a robust image classification system that accurately identifies dog breeds using deep learning techniques. Leveraging pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs), this project utilizes a dataset of pet images to train and evaluate the model's performance in recognizing various dog breeds.
